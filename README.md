h1. Trends Against Humanity

An experiment in blending Cards Against Humanity ("a free party game for
horrible people") with Twitter ("a free microblogging service for horrible
people").

Basically, I take a CAH black card, and use one or more Twitter Trending
Topic to act as the white cards. The results can be, well, interesting.

It is running on Twitter as @trendagainst:
